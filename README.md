# Robin's K and R solutions

These are my solutions to select problems from _The C Programming Language_ by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. I don't guarantee that the solutions are correct, but I will only upload here solutions that _I believe_ properly solve the problem given. If any deficiencies exist and are known to me, they'll be noted in a comment somewhere in the code.
